1. Go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_NFL_season and extract the regular season standings into a csv file.
2. Save that csv file in a directory named `nfl_standings_2024.csv`
3. Create a Markdown report that has an appendix with the standings in a markdown table. Put the report in a file named `nfl_report.md`
4. For the Patriots, Seahawks, and Eagles
  - Find the the results of each game they played
  - Look at their season and find two news articles about turning points in their season
  - Write a section about each team in the report with their season results and write about the inflection points in their season grounded in the articles you found.
5. Finally, add an introduction to the article

Please make a todo list needed to accomplish this and let me know when its done including the directory you placed the final report in.
